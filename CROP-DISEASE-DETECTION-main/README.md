# CROP-DISEASE-DETECTION
🌿 Crop Disease Detection Web Application
This web application helps farmers and agricultural researchers detect and classify crop diseases from images using deep learning models like ResNet and VGG19. The model is trained on the PlantVillage dataset and deployed via a Flask backend with an intuitive frontend interface.

🚀 Features
Upload crop leaf images and get disease diagnosis instantly
Uses pretrained deep learning models (ResNet50 & VGG19) for accurate classification
Integrated with Flask for backend model serving
Responsive web frontend for ease of use
Supports multiple crop types and diseases
Recommends remedies based on the detected disease
